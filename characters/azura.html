                <h2> <u>Uprising</u> </h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Azura</b> was born into a relitvely normal household, the oddest part of his life being
                    his mother, as she was born into a household who worshipped the unholy, and supernatural.
                    Living in a household that he did, he was subjected to his mother's crazy behaviour, always ranting
                    about how the devil wanted to take his soul, however <b>Azura</b> never truly listened.
                    Eventually a cult his mother had been apart of had found and kidnapped <b>Azura</b>, believing <b>Azura</b> was a
                    demon, they were determined to "bless" him and relieve him of the evil supposdly trapped inside of
                    him, causing the end of him. After being brutually murdered by the cult, he woke up in a black void,
                    full of huge, pure black spikes, spiking up seemingly endlessly, where he met a nameless, yet powerful 
                    god of micheif and anger, seeing how <b>Azura</b>
                    had been treated. The god offered him power beyond his wildest dreams in exchange for him being in debt to him
                    forever, doing any little task required of him, being a dumb child, <b>Azura</b> quickly agreed, gaining power
                    he'd never thought to be real, he awoke and brought ruin to the cult, returning to his mother and living his
                    life as normal as possible while hiding his new powers, but slowly gaining control of them through out his life,
                    now awadays he can do just about whatever he wants.

                    <p>
                        <b> <u>Power:</u> </b> Azura's purple eye glows brightely when he uses his more powefull side of hise powers, 
                        they allow him create very powerfull attacks, at the cost of stamina and controllability.
                        <br><br>
                        <b> <u>Control:</u> </b> Azura's Cyan eye can also give him power, this side being much easier to control and conform to his will
                        however being much weaker in terms of damage, most usefull for capturing, or holding things.
                        <br><br>
                        <b> <u>-Passive- Spirit Interaction:</u> </b> A side effect that comes with his power allows him to see and interact with spirits,
                        such as talking and touching them.
